  **NumberOfBackupJobsFailed** only shows "The number of backup jobs that AWS Backup scheduled but did not start".
  If a job is started but then failed, we will not be able to check the jobs status throught this variable. So we
  compare NumberOfBackupJobsCreated and NumberOfBackupJobsCompleted over a day.
